This is a quite powerful calculator to find out stoichiometric numbers of chemical reactions.

Program take in input an equation is such format: "SUBSTANCE_1 + SUBSTANCE_2 + ... + SUBSTANCE_N -> SUBSTANCE_1 + SUBSTANCE_2 + ... + SUBSTANCE_N" and return new equation,
where stoichiometric numbers are next to substances or there could be no numbers (this means number is 1).

Also, this calculator was used by Martyniuk I.V. and Martyniuk G.V. in their article
‘COMPUTER TECHNOLOGIES IN THE STUDY OF CHEMISTRY AS A MEANS OF SELF-REALISATION OF EDUCATION’
during the VII International Scientific and Practical Internet Conference ‘Chemistry, Biotechnology, Ecology and Education’
