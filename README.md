This is a fairly powerful calculator for finding the stoichiometric numbers of chemical reactions.

The programme takes an equation as input in such a format: "SUBSTANCE_1 + SUBSTANCE_2 + ... + SUBSTANCE_N -> SUBSTANCE_1 + SUBSTANCE_2 + ... + SUBSTANCE_N" and returns a new equation, where the stoichiometric numbers are next to the substances or there could be no numbers (this means that the number is 1).

This calculator was also used by Martyniuk I.V. and Martyniuk G.V. in their article "COMPUTER TECHNOLOGIES IN STUDY OF CHEMISTRY AS A MEAN OF SELF-REALISATION OF EDUCATION" during the VII International Scientific and Practical Internet Conference "Chemistry, Biotechnology, Ecology and Education".
